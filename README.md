# Welcome to our website, all about COVID.

Progress for week of January 11th:

Completed goals:

- REST API on home page by Ketki<br>
--> used data from an online api with covid data from each state <br>
--> compiled data from 3 categories (total cases, total deaths, and total hospitalizations) into a table.<br>
--> also added some extras to the the table, such as a dark header, highting when you hover, and lines between all rows and columns<br>
--> data updates every day, numbers change<br>
--> can always add more columns to table if needed<br>

- Began framework for US Map by Ketki<br>
--> followed tutorial from https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/ <br>
--> map also utilizes api, it takes a map from another api website.<br>
--> very basic map, no data yet<br>
--> can zoom in and out on map<br>
--> code for map was in java script, so it was a challenge to figure out how to call that code in our project, which is HTML and python<br>
--> Goal is to have data from table visible on map when hovering on a state<br>

- Begun and uploaded parts of big idea 2/3 by Lucas<br>
--> Created a survery tab so the user can upload their email to the website<br>
--> Survey uses html for basic parts<br>
--> Other half uses css for the looks<br>
--> Can click back to original menu by upper right hand corner or by filling out the form<br>
--> After filling out the form properly you will be sent back to the menu<br>
--> The goal for next week is to finish the code where the emails are uploaded into a database<br>
