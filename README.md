Progress for week of January 11th:

SCRUM GRADING:

## Tickets

- Began framework for US Map by Ketki<br>
--> followed tutorial from https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/ <br>
--> map also utilizes api, it takes a map from another api website.<br>
--> very basic map, no data yet<br>
--> can zoom in and out on map<br>
--> code for map was in java script, so it was a challenge to figure out how to call that code in our project, which is HTML and python<br>
--> Goal is to have data from table visible on map when hovering on a state<br>

- Begun to work to create a session for the website by Lucas <br>
--> The session will attach to the database to allow users to access the website<br>
--> Uses SQLite<br>
--> No CSS yet<br>
--> Also linked the easter egg through the picture click<br>

- Compeleted deploying the website and all forms with it by Dayita <br>
--> Made on the virtual box<br>
--> Completes all the requirements for the deploy process<br>
--> Can be assessed through link<br>

- Iniyaa <br>
--> Embedded links to college board<br> 
--> Also embedded links to Ap prep materials such as weekly tests and journals<br> 
--> Used the same design to make it look just like the other parts of our website<br>
--> Links through the California page<br>
--> Rethink ticket idea, previous idea doesn't have hardcore data to go with it<br>
--> Changed idea - check boxes or choose button and result is likelyhood of catching covid<br>
