# Welcome to our website, all about COVID.

Progress for week of January 11th:

Completed goals:

- REST API on home page by Ketki
--> used data from an online api with covid data from each state 
--> compiled data from 3 categories (total cases, total deaths, and total hospitalizations) into a table.
--> also added some extras to the the table, such as a dark header, highting when you hover, and lines between all rows and columns
--> data updates every day, numbers change
--> can always add more columns to table if needed
