# Welcome to our COVID information site.

<h2>Website Overview:</h2>
This website is a COVID 19 Website designed to make sure you can take appropriate precautitons to stay safe during this global pandemic. The home page contains a table which is the output of a RestAPI. This table provides some of the most important COVID stats in all 50 states. In the navigation bar, you can see that there are multiple pages. The map page is interactive and has additional covid stats rgarding each state but in a geographical view for a better understanding of the severity of covid in different states. There is also a big states dropdown, which highlights the information in some states. There is also a login page which requries an email and password. Those who create an account and log in get directed to a new page. This page is still being worked on and will be a covid risk assesment program. This requries the user to imput some details about themselves and the output will be the level of their COVID 19 risk.

# Completed Tickets!
<h2> COVID Data REST API: by Ketki</h2> <br>
This api pulls data from a json formatted file, and it displays the data on the homescreen of the website. The Json file contains lots of data for all 50 states, but I have only displayed key categories of data in the table. The table also uses features from bootstrap.

<h2> Interactive COVID map: by Ketki</h2> <br>
This map pulls data from the same source as the table. When you hover on each state, you see the data for that state. States are also color coded based on the number of cases there. The map code has mostly been taken from <a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/"> here</a> with some modifications.

<h2> Easter Egg: by Iniyaa </h2> <br>
The easter egg, which can be accessed by clicking on the image of California under the CA page (accessed from navbar), displays our study journals, which have information on the College Board exam, as well as AP CSP fundamental standards.

<h2> Database: by Lucas </h2> <br>
The database has a full hsitory of who used and signed up for the website via SQLite. The tab for the database can be found under the Sign-Up tab on the nav bar. After the database is complete, a session should be connected to that part of the website so only those who has signed up by giving there email and password can access the covid data.

<h2> NavBar: by Dayita </h2> <br>
The navbar code allows you to click on the links for different pages, and you are routed to those pages.

# Goals for Tickets! (more details on <a href="https://github.com/krispykreme14/flask-idea-homesite/projects/1">project board)</a>

 -->Add CSS, images, and other graphics to make website look more professional;remove jumbotrons, etc.  <br>

 -->Get the session up and running. <br>
  
 -->Add mini apis for each of the individual states pages  have them show live data, as opposed to typed numbers  <br>
  
 -->Add exclusive section for people who log inanalyze their risk based on their location/other factors  <br>

 --> Incorporate Scrum Crossover suggestions: Having the database login take you to an individual page for each user, add commas for the numbers on the table so it would be easier to look at the data. 
 <br>
 
 # College Board Components in Project: detailed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvmA9GZcO8op97wN5xIIAKVJGVGQ2c368WFzBFz937I/edit?usp=sharing">project plan worksheet</a>
<h2> Lists </h2> <br> A list is a data type that represents a countable number of ordered values. In our project, we used lists as dictionaries for the abbrievaiation of states.
<h2> Inputs </h2> <br> An input tells the user what to put in in the code. In our project, we used inputs that trigger the events for the database. Using this the database is able to work correctly with whatever inputs the user wants to input.
<h2> Outputs </h2> <br> An output is data that a computer sends. In our project, we created a REST API which fetches live data about COVID in the United states. Then, the data is formatted into a table, which is on the homepage of our site. The data on the table is the output of the API.
<h2> Procedures </h2> <br> A procedure is a small section of a program that performs a specific task. We have not used it yet and it is currently in progress and will be used to create risk assessment.
<h2> Algorithms </h2> <br> An algorithm is a specific procedure for solving a well-defined computational problem. We have not used it in our code yet and it is currently in progress. It will be used in the Covid Risk assessment factor where you input the factors that impact you and the output is what your risk is.

## Tickets Progress: 6 week mark

- Began framework for US Map by Ketki<br>
--> followed tutorial from https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/ <br>
--> map also utilizes api, it takes a map from another api website.<br>
--> can zoom in and out on map<br>
--> code for map was in java script, so it was a challenge to figure out how to call that code in our project, which is HTML and python<br>
--> Goal is to have data from table visible on map when hovering on a state<br>

- Begun to work to create a session for the website by Lucas <br>
--> Using this tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zz97NVbH0U <br>
--> The session will attach to the database to allow users to access the website<br>
--> Uses SQLite<br>
--> No CSS yet<br>
--> Also linked the easter egg through the picture click<br>

- Compeleted deploying the website and all forms with it by Dayita <br>
--> Made on the virtual box<br>
--> Completes all the requirements for the deploy process<br>
--> Can be assessed through link<br>

- Iniyaa <br>
--> Embedded links to college board<br> 
--> Also embedded links to Ap prep materials such as weekly tests and journals<br> 
--> Used the same design to make it look just like the other parts of our website<br>
--> Links through the California page<br>
--> Rethink ticket idea, previous idea doesn't have hardcore data to go with it<br>
--> Changed idea - check boxes or choose button and result is likelyhood of catching covid<br>
