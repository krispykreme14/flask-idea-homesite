# Welcome to Comedy Central!
This website is where you can learn about all things comedy. We have everything from knock knock jokes, programming jokes, a featured joke, comedians and comedy through the decades, and the history of comedy!

## How To Run:
Press Run and click on IP address link given from INTELLIJ. You will be directed to the Home page, which will have welcome message. Use the menu to be redirected to other pages. If you add /playground into the URL, you can find the secret joke :). Additionally, the home page has a button which will take you to the Flask Web Portfolio, which has links to all of our journals and projects. In the Web Portolio there are links to our project plans and code for the Hello Series Project and the Flask Series Project(code found on Github link). There is also a link to our study journals as well. 

## Purpose of The Project
This project helped us to learn about the HTML language and some CSS. In this project, both Python and HTML are used, and we used the Python Fundamentals to code this website using Flask.

## File Descriptions
main.py: is in python, imports the html files. Has routes for each page and URL.

base.html: base for website, the back end which connects all the components

comediandecades.html: has information about some iconic comedians through the ages, as well as an embedded video for each comedian

historyofcomdedy.html: has fun facts about the history of comedy, and how comedy came to be

home.html: our home page, the first thing you see when you click the link to the website

knock.html: our page full of jokes that will knock your socks off.

submit.html: a place where you can submit jokes for a chance to be featured on the website!

playground.html: a page we used to test code if we need to preview something before putting it on a main page

ava.html: page that shows work from individual mastery week as well as artifacts embedded in google docs. There is also a link to Ava's Github account found on the top of the page as a button.  

ketki.html: embedded the study journal and repl.it playground.

lucas.html: learn a little about Lucas as well as access the project scope and his study journal

iniyaa.html: has artifacts from individual mastery of HTML and Python embedded into a jumbotron.
## Learning Outcomes
As a result of this Flask Project Series, we have furthered our knowledge in Computer Science, now understanding HTML and a little of CSS. Before, we had just known Python, however working with different templates and files exposed us to new language and properties of computer science. We also learned about new tools such as Github and INTELLIJ which we used to run and create this project. 

## Mastery of Code Examples: 
* Front End - HTML, Jinja
    * Menus, title/page content blocks(Jinja), more templates
* Back End
    * Routes to each page found on main.py
        * /playground page testing page
    * Lists and dictionaries in projects.py
* Python
    * Most work found in Hello Series(found in portfolio on homepage)
    * Use of python to create routes for different files
Tools
    * Github repository has all code
    * Running out of INTELLIJ


## Use Of AP CSP Requirements:
* Big Idea 1: Creative Development  
    * First project with the use of INTELLIJ rather than repl.it
    * Able to use INTELLIJ and Github to collaborate with scrum team, while assigning individual tasks to everyone
    * Weekly reflections on learning and work to keep our development process on track
* Big Idea 2: Data
    * Data compression 
    * Able to run on INTELLIJ much faster and more reliably than repl.it
* Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming
    * Website menus and coding
        * Embedding resources and videos 
        * Formatting
        * Drop down menus
* Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Networks
    * Deployment with Raspberry Pi
        * Runtime Link
        * IP address link
    * Integration for N@M
* Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing/Ethics
    * Practiced safe computing and was ethical about all of our code used
