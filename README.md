# Welcome to our COVID information site.

<h2>Website Overview:</h2>
This website is a COVID 19 Website designed to make sure you can take appropriate precautitons to stay safe during this global pandemic. The home page contains a table which is the output of a RestAPI. This table provides some of the most important COVID stats in all 50 states. In the navigation bar, you can see that there are multiple pages. The map page is interactive and has additional covid stats rgarding each state but in a geographical view for a better understanding of the severity of covid in different states. There is also a big states dropdown, which highlights the information in some states. There is also a login page which requries an email and password. Those who create an account and log in get directed to a new page. This page is still being worked on and will be a covid risk assesment program. This requries the user to imput some details about themselves and the output will be the level of their COVID 19 risk.

SCRUM GRADING:

## Tickets

- Began framework for US Map by Ketki<br>
--> followed tutorial from https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/ <br>
--> map also utilizes api, it takes a map from another api website.<br>
--> can zoom in and out on map<br>
--> code for map was in java script, so it was a challenge to figure out how to call that code in our project, which is HTML and python<br>
--> Goal is to have data from table visible on map when hovering on a state<br>

- Begun to work to create a session for the website by Lucas <br>
--> Using this tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Zz97NVbH0U <br>
--> The session will attach to the database to allow users to access the website<br>
--> Uses SQLite<br>
--> No CSS yet<br>
--> Also linked the easter egg through the picture click<br>

- Compeleted deploying the website and all forms with it by Dayita <br>
--> Made on the virtual box<br>
--> Completes all the requirements for the deploy process<br>
--> Can be assessed through link<br>

- Iniyaa <br>
--> Embedded links to college board<br> 
--> Also embedded links to Ap prep materials such as weekly tests and journals<br> 
--> Used the same design to make it look just like the other parts of our website<br>
--> Links through the California page<br>
--> Rethink ticket idea, previous idea doesn't have hardcore data to go with it<br>
--> Changed idea - check boxes or choose button and result is likelyhood of catching covid<br>
