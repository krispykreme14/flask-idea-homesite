# Welcome to our website, all about COVID.

Progress for week of January 11th:

SCRUM GRADING:
17/20 - site is not deployed yet, so that is a big missing feature. Also, big ticket features are good, but could reflect more collaboration and work from multiple scrum members. big ticket features are started, but not yet completed. We have goals for next week, and will work to accomplish them.

*hit the projects tab to view our scrum board. all tasks from this week are under in progress or completed and ready to be deployed columns.

Completed goals:

- REST API on home page by Ketki<br>
--> used data from an online api with covid data from each state <br>
--> compiled data from 3 categories (total cases, total deaths, and total hospitalizations) into a table.<br>
--> also added some extras to the the table, such as a dark header, highting when you hover, and lines between all rows and columns<br>
--> data updates every day, numbers change<br>
--> can always add more columns to table if needed<br>

- Began framework for US Map by Ketki<br>
--> followed tutorial from https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/ <br>
--> map also utilizes api, it takes a map from another api website.<br>
--> very basic map, no data yet<br>
--> can zoom in and out on map<br>
--> code for map was in java script, so it was a challenge to figure out how to call that code in our project, which is HTML and python<br>
--> Goal is to have data from table visible on map when hovering on a state<br>

- Begun and uploaded parts of big idea 2/3 by Lucas<br>
--> Created a survery tab so the user can upload their email to the website<br>
--> Survey uses html for basic parts<br>
--> Other half uses css for the looks<br>
--> Can click back to original menu by upper right hand corner or by filling out the form<br>
--> After filling out the form properly you will be sent back to the menu<br>
--> The goal for next week is to finish the code where the emails are uploaded into a database<br>
