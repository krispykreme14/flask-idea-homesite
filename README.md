Progress for week of January 11th:

SCRUM GRADING:
17/20 - site is not deployed yet, so that is a big missing feature. Also, big ticket features are good, but could reflect more collaboration and work from multiple scrum members. big ticket features are started, but not yet completed. We have goals for next week, and will work to accomplish them.

*hit the projects tab to view our scrum board. all tasks from this week are under in progress or completed and ready to be deployed columns.

## Tickets

--> map also utilizes api, it takes a map from another api website.<br>
--> very basic map, no data yet<br>
--> can zoom in and out on map<br>
--> code for map was in java script, so it was a challenge to figure out how to call that code in our project, which is HTML and python<br>
--> Goal is to have data from table visible on map when hovering on a state<br>

- Begun to work to create a session for the website by Lucas <br>
--> The session will attach to the database to allow users to access the website<br>
--> Uses SQLite<br>
--> No CSS yet<br>
--> Also linked the easter egg through the picture click<br>

- Compeleted deploying the website and all forms with it by Dayita <br>
--> Made on the virtual box<br>
--> Completes all the requirements for the deploy process<br>
